Gently stipple the minerals on your eye lids.   Make sure your \nskin is well hydrated so the minerals will adhere.  Try misting your \nskin with Pure Anada Marine Mineral Toner, prior to applying your \nmakeup.If your shadow is prone to creasing, make sure your lids are free \nfrom excess oils before applying shadow.  If the problem is persistant, \ntry priming your lids with Pure Anada Matte Minerals Finishing Powder or\n a coordinating Velvet Matte Shadow.\nDeep shades of loose mineral shadow can be used as eyeliner.  To \ncreate a soft dry line, dip an angled liner brush into the powder, tap \nit off and line your eyes.  Or to create a liquid liner, wet your brush \nand dip it into the powder.  The minerals will stick to the brush.  Make\n a paste on the back of your hand, or in the lid of the jar.

The all-new paddle-shaped tip gives\n you two looks in one—thick and dramatic or thin and elegant. The \nintense black formula glides on smoothly and dries quickly for instant \ndrama. Clinically tested, suitable for sensitive eyes.Directions: Stand 6 inches away from a mirror and tilt your chin up, so \nthat when you look down your nose into the mirror, you can see your \nentire eyelid. Dab concealer or dust translucent powder on your upper \nlids. Blend well with a sponge or lightly pat with a fingertip to cover \nveins and prevent creasing.Before applying liner, \ndetermine your eye shape. If eyes are close-set or round, line only the \nouter corners. Otherwise, line the entire upper lid.Gently pull your eyelid taut at an upward angle. Beginning at the inner \ncorner, draw small, connected dashes along the top lashes. Be sure to \nstay close to the roots so there is no skin visible between the lashes \nand the liner. To make eyes look bigger, extend the liner slightly \nbeyond the outer corners.Use a cotton swab to fix mistakes. For larger messes, dip it in makeup remover.",

        "description": "Misa's original nail lacquer formula was developed to meet the product requirements of demanding nail technicians. Each lacquer is properly balanced with resin, plasticizer and nitrocellulose to provide a durable film that offers high gloss, exceptional wear and maximum protection for the nail.The lacquers provide durability for the ultimate in chip-free results, with each lacquer offering a carefully balanced blend of film formers that are not adversely affected when exposed to water or detergents. The formula is nonfading with lasting color fidelity over time, as the use of UV absorbers helps maintain the true colors. The lacquers maintain an excellent shelf life, with a formula that prevents pigment migration, striation, settling and syneresis over longer periods of time than most other nail enamel formulas. And, as we guarantee, the chip-resistant polishes promise superior wear and exceptional gloss retention, while helping to condition, protect, strengthen and reinforce the natural nail.",
